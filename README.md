### This resource pack requires [Continuty](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) to work (or Optifine if you still use that)

# It's All Connected

This resource pack uses CTM to connect every texture in vanilla Minecraft that makes sense to be. The way I did this is different than other CTM texture packs, as is shown from this example:

My implementation preserves the vanilla look of blocks, while making it look smoother with CTM.

# Current status

Update for 1.21 just released with textures for new blocks! also, all textures have been upgraded and any problems have been fixed.

# Compatibility

This texture pack should work with most versions of Minecraft, as long as you have Continuity or Optifine. However, I have not tested versions before 1.20.

Some texture packs do not work well with this, mostly 3D models or block state specific models. An example of both of these is the 'Visual Note Block Pitch' texture in Vanilla Tweaks.
