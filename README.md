### This resource pack requires [Continuty](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) to work (or Optifine if you still use that)

# It's All Connected

This resource used CTM to connect every texture in vanilla Minecraft that makes sense to be. The way I did this is different than other CTM texture packs, as is shown from these examples:

# Current status

So far, I have done every texture however I have not checked over them. This means that some textures may not work or may not look the best, however I am hoping fix all these issues in the next release.

# Compatibility

This texture pack should work with most versions of Minecraft, as long as you have Continuity or Optifine. However, I have not tested versions before 1.20.

Some texture packs do not work well with this, mostly 3D models or block state specific models. An example of both of these is the 'Visual Note Block Pitch' texture in Vanilla Tweaks.
